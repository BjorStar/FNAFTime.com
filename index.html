            Mark: Hello everybody, my name is Markiplier and welcome to Five Nights at Freddy's, an indie horror
            game
            that you guys suggested, en masse, and I saw that Yamimash played it and he said it was really really
            good... So I'm very eager to see what is up. And that is a terrifying animatronic bear! 'Family pizzeria
            looking for security guard to work the nightshift.' Oh... 12 a.m. The first night. If I didn't wanna
            stay
            the first night, why would I stay any more than... five... Why I stay any more than two- hello? Okay...

            <h3>Phone rings</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Hello?... Hello? Oh, oh I can't move. That is a creepy skull, there's creepy things on the
                wall.
                Oh, hello.</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: Hello?</h3>

            </h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: Um, I actually worked in that office before you.</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: I'm finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact.</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Hm?</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming...</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Ugh! U-hu-hu...</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: ...but I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about.</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Eh...</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week.</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Okay, sounds g- Okay...</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: Okay? Uh, let's see, first there's an introductory greeting from the company that I'm
                supposed to read.</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Mm-hm.</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: Uh, it's kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, "Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Okay.</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike...</h3>

            <h3>Mark: (Scared laughing)</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: where fantasy and fun come to life.</h3>

                discovering
                that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon
                property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced.
            </h3>

            <h3>Mark: (panicking)</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: Blah blah blah, now that might sound bad, I know...</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Yeah!</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: ...but there's really nothing to worry about. Uh, the animatronic characters here do get
                a
                bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No.</h3>

            <h3>Mark: (Scared laughing)</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath?
                I'd
                probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a special place in the
                hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right?</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Okay!</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: Okay.</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Okay...</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit.</h3>

            <h3>Mark: No they...</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: Uh, they're left in some kind of free roaming mode at night.</h3>

            <h3>Mark: (Scared laughing)</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: Uh...Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long.</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Ugh...</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too, but then there was The
                Bite of
                '87.</h3>

            <h3>Mark: The bite?!</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: Yeah.</h3>

            <h3>Mark: What bite!?</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Why?!</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if
                any,
                is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't
                recognize
                you as a person.</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Oh, OH!</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: They'll p-they'll most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on. Now
                since that's against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to... forcefully
                stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit.</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Oh, I get it.</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad if the suits themselves weren't filled with crossbeams,
                wires, and animatronic devices...</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Uh-huh.</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: ...especially around the facial area.</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Uh-huh.</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: So, you could imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could
                cause
                a bit of discomfort...</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Yeah!</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: ...and death. Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again
                would be
                your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh.</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Ugh! Oh, why... What happened?</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: Y-Yeah, they don't tell you these things when you sign up. But hey, first day should be a
                breeze. I'll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only
                if
                absolutely necessary.</h3>

            <h3>Mark: That's not good...</h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: Gotta conserve power. Alright, good night.</h3>

            <h3>Call ends</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Good night?!</h3>

            <h3>Mark: Oh no... Oh that's bad! I understand what I need to do. I need to watch the cams so that they
                don't come after m- One's missing!</h3>

                different...
                than any horror game I've ever played. So what you gotta do in case you're not getting it is you
                gotta
                watch the cameras to make sure they don't come by- and you only got a little much power- Is he still
                there? Hi, you're still there. Wait a minute, what, Did you move?! Okay, you didn't move. You don't
                move
                neither... You don't move nothing... If I see you moving... I don't wanna see anything...Oh-oh-oh my

            <h3>Phone starts to call</h3>
            <h3>
                Mark: Oh hi, hi again! Do you have any see- sage advice for me? Yep. Okay, yep. I know. Yep. Yep yep
                yep, what I can do for you? I know! Oh god...
            </h3>

            <h3>Phone Guy: Uh, Hello?</h3>
            <h3>Mark: Hi.</h3>
            <h3>Phone Guy: Hello? Uh, well, if you're hearing this then you made it to day two, uh, congrats!</h3>
            <h3>Mark: (laughs in panic)</h3>
            <h3>Phone Guy: Uh, I-I won't talk quite as long this time since Freddy and his friends tend to become
                more
                active as the week progresses.</h3>
            <h3>Mark: What?</h3>
            <h3>Phone Guy: Uhh, it might be a good idea to peek at those cameras while I talk just to make sure
                everyone's in their proper place, you know. Bonnie is in Dining Area</h3>
            <h3>Mark: No.</h3>
            <h3>Phone Guy: Uh... Interestingly enough, Freddy himself doesn't come off stage very often. I heard he
                becomes a lot more active in the dark though, so, hey, I guess that's one more reason not to run out
                of
                power, right?</h3>
            <h3>Mark: (panicked laughter)</h3>
            <h3>Phone Guy: Uh, I also want to emphasize the importance of using your door lights. There are blind
                spots
                in your camera view, and those blind spots happen to be right outside your doors. So if-if you can’t
                find something, or someone, on your cameras... Bonnie is in the West Hall Mark: Ugh-h!</h3>
            <h3>Phone Guy: ...uh, be sure to check the door lights. Uh, you might only have a few seconds to
                react...
                Uh, not that you would be in any danger, of course. I'm not implying that.</h3>
            <h3>Mark: Of course!</h3>
            <h3>Phone Guy: Uh, also, uh, check on the curtain in Pirate Cove from time to time. The character in
                there
                seems to be unique in that he becomes more active if the cameras remain off for long periods of
                time.
                Uh, I guess he doesn't like being watched. Bonnie is in W. Hall Corner</h3>
            <h3>Mark: Ugh-gh! Uh!</h3>
            <h3>Phone Guy: I don't know. Anyway, I'm sure you have everything under control. Uh, talk to you soon.
                Call
                ends</h3>
            <h3>Mark: Where's Pirate Cove? Why are you going to leave me with this? Don't leave me like this!

                like terrifying if you... controlled the cameras with like an Oculus Rift or something. Oh, my god.
